    "Hey, my name is Pat. I'm a web engineer based in sunny Orange County, California. Some of my favorite aspects of web development are making apps and tools, npm packages, reuseable react components, GraphQL and REST APIs, writing tests, and bringing life to great designs. Currently I work as a web enginner at the video game company NCSOFT.",
    "I'm also into other things: roasting coffee, music composition, drums, teaching, gaming, woodworking, beer, bread, making long lists, being a husband and father, and geeking out on life in general."
