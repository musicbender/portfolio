          "Hey, my name is Pat. I'm a web engineer based in sunny Orange County, California. Some of my favorite aspects of web development are making apps and tools, npm packages, reuseable react components, express APIs, writing tests (yes, you read that correctly) and bringing life to great designs. Currently I work as a front-end web enginner at the video game company NCSOFT.",
